1.What is Collection in Java?
In Java, a collection is an object that represents a group of elements, known as its elements or members. The Collection framework in Java provides a set of interfaces and classes that allow for the storage, retrieval, manipulation, and traversal of collections of objects. It provides a unified and standardized way to work with groups of elements.

2. Differentiate between Collection and collections in the context of Java.
Collection (with a capital "C"):

Collection is an interface defined in the Java Collection framework.
It is a part of the Java API and represents a group of objects, known as elements, that can be accessed, manipulated, and iterated over.
The Collection interface provides a common set of methods for working with collections, such as adding, removing, or iterating over elements.
Examples of classes that implement the Collection interface are ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet.
collections (with a lowercase "c"):

"collections" refers to the broader concept of groups or containers that hold multiple elements in Java programming.
It is a general term that encompasses all types of collections, including those that implement the Collection interface and other related data structures.
Collections can be implemented using various classes, interfaces, and data structures in Java, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, and more.
The term "collections" is often used to refer to the different classes and data structures available in the Java Collection framework that facilitate the management and manipulation of groups of objects.

3. What are the advantages of the Collection framework?
Reusability: The Collection framework provides a set of reusable interfaces and classes that can be used to manage collections of objects. This promotes code reuse and avoids the need to reinvent data structures or algorithms for common collection operations.

Standardization: The Collection framework defines a set of standard interfaces and contracts that specify common behaviors and operations for working with collections. This standardization makes it easier to understand and work with different types of collections, as they all adhere to the same set of methods and conventions.

Abstraction: The Collection framework provides a high-level abstraction for working with collections. It abstracts away the complexities of underlying data structures and algorithms, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their applications rather than low-level details.

4.Explain the various interfaces used in the Collection framework.

Collection Interface:

The Collection interface is the root interface in the Collection hierarchy.
It defines the basic operations for working with collections, such as adding, removing, and querying elements.
Subinterfaces of Collection include List, Set, and Queue, each with their specific behaviors and characteristics.
List Interface:

The List interface extends the Collection interface and represents an ordered collection (sequence) of elements.
It allows duplicate elements and maintains the insertion order of elements.
Key implementations of List include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.
Set Interface:

The Set interface extends the Collection interface and represents a collection of unique elements with no specific order.
It does not allow duplicate elements.
Key implementations of Set include HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

5.Differentiate between List and Set in Java.

Duplicate Elements:

List: Allows duplicate elements. Elements can be inserted multiple times in a List, and they are maintained in the order of insertion.
Set: Does not allow duplicate elements. Each element in a Set must be unique, and duplicate elements are automatically eliminated.
Order:

List: Preserves the order of elements. The order of elements in a List is determined by the sequence of their insertion.
Set: Does not guarantee any specific order of elements. The elements in a Set may be stored in a particular order or in a seemingly random order depending on the implementation.
Indexing and Positional Access:

List: Supports indexing and positional access to elements. Elements in a List can be accessed and retrieved by their index using methods like get(index) or manipulated using methods like add(index, element) or remove(index).
Set: Does not support indexing or positional access. Elements in a Set can only be added or removed without specific reference to their position.

6.What is the Differentiate between Iterator and ListIterator in Java.

Collection Type:

Iterator: The Iterator interface can be used to iterate over elements in any collection type, including lists, sets, and queues.
ListIterator: The ListIterator interface is specifically designed for iterating over elements in lists. It extends the Iterator interface and provides additional functionality specific to lists, such as bidirectional traversal.
Direction of Traversal:

Iterator: Iterates over a collection in a forward direction only. It allows sequential access to the elements using methods like hasNext() and next().
ListIterator: Iterates over a list in both forward and backward directions. It allows bidirectional traversal, meaning it can move both forward and backward within the list. ListIterator provides methods like hasNext(), next(), hasPrevious(), previous(), etc., to support bidirectional movement.
Modification of Elements:

Iterator: Supports removing elements from a collection during iteration using the remove() method. It does not support adding or modifying elements.
ListIterator: Supports adding, removing, and modifying elements while iterating over a list. It provides additional methods like add(), set(), and remove() to perform such operations.

7.What is the Differentiate between Comparable and Comparator

Interface Usage:

Comparable: The Comparable interface is used for defining the natural ordering of objects. It is implemented by the class of the objects being compared.
Comparator: The Comparator interface is used for defining custom comparison logic separate from the objects being compared. It is implemented by a separate class that is responsible for comparing objects.
Object-Specific vs. External Comparison:

Comparable: The comparison logic is implemented within the class of the objects being compared. Each object knows how to compare itself to other objects.
Comparator: The comparison logic is implemented in a separate class external to the objects being compared. This allows for multiple comparison implementations for the same objects.
Single vs. Multiple Sorting Criteria:

Comparable: Supports only single sorting criteria. The comparison logic defined in the compareTo() method is used for all comparisons.
Comparator: Allows for multiple sorting criteria. Different Comparator implementations can be created to define different comparison logic based on specific criteria.

8.What is collision in HashMap?

Collisions in HashMaps are inevitable, especially as the number of keys increases. However, a well-designed hash function and an appropriate load factor can help minimize collisions and maintain good performance. The load factor determines the maximum ratio of entries to buckets before the HashMap automatically resizes and rehashes the entries to distribute them more evenly, reducing the likelihood of collisions.

9.Distinguish between a hashmap and a Treemap.

Ordering of Elements:

HashMap: Does not provide any specific order for the elements. The iteration order of a HashMap is not predictable or based on the keys' natural order.
TreeMap: Maintains the elements in a sorted order based on the keys' natural order or a custom Comparator if specified. The elements are sorted according to their keys, which allows for efficient searching and iteration.
Performance:

HashMap: Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (such as get and put) on average, regardless of the size of the map. However, the actual performance can degrade if the hash function produces many collisions.
TreeMap: Provides logarithmic-time performance for basic operations (such as get and put) based on the height of the tree. Searching, insertion, and deletion take longer than in HashMap due to the tree structure, but TreeMap guarantees a sorted order of the keys.
Key Restrictions:

HashMap: Allows null keys (only one null key) and permits duplicate values. The keys must be unique, but the values can be duplicated.
TreeMap: Does not allow null keys and permits duplicate values. The keys must be unique and are sorted based on their natural order or a custom Comparator.

10.Define LinkedHashMap in Java

In Java, LinkedHashMap is a class that extends the HashMap class and implements the Map interface. It is a variation of the HashMap implementation that maintains the insertion order of elements. LinkedHashMap combines the fast retrieval and lookup capabilities of a HashMap with the ability to iterate over the entries in the order in which they were inserted.
